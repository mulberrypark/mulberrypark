		<h3>About us:</h3>
        <P> Mulberry Park Management Company Ltd is ... <br>
            <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
            A small private residential estate comprising of six streets and 130 properties, it was formerly a part of the RAF Finningley Camp but
            <br> it is now run by the property shareholders for the benefit of the estate's residents.
        <br>
        <br>
            Presently there are two estate Directors:
            <br>
            <b>&bull; Angie Perkins - director for 17+ years<br></b>
            <b>&bull; Barry Roughley - director for 4+ years<br></b>
            <br>

                <div class="text-center">

                <br>
           <br>
           <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
           The Directors of Mulberry Park Management Company Ltd are <b> unpaid </b> and they deal solely with the maintenance of <br>
           the estate's private roads, footpaths, drainage, street lighting and upkeep of the trees, common grassed and planted areas. <br>
           The Directors will not get involved in neighbour disputes etc. <br>
        <br>
           The estate's maintenance management costs are funded from the <b>annual service management fees </b> collected from the property shareholders. <br> 
           The annual safety and routine maintenance of the estate enables us to keep the cost down for every resident. <br> 
           The level of service charge is reviewed annually by the Directors and the Management Agents and <br> 
           it may be increased to reflect annual inflation and the ongoing maintenance needs of the estate.<br>
        <br>
           Our aim is to maintain the safety, serviceability and sustainability of the estate, to improve how it looks and how its run and to try and <br>
           become a more cohesive community led and supported organisation by offering a voice and opportunity for all <br>
           who care to participate in the running of the estate and to have a say in its future direction.<br>
